\chapter*{Abstract}
To obtain a better understanding of energy consumption patterns at an individual household level; this paper seeks to construct distinct, yet widely applicable, energy profiles that capture frequently reoccurring patterns, habits, as well as behaviors associated with the individuals that occupy said households. These energy profiles can be constructed through a variety of different techniques, that includes the likes of clustering algorithms such as K-means and \gls{dbscan}, that will be explored throughout the duration of this paper both in terms of their efficacy in terms of capturing the patterns present in the data as well as how the resulting energy profiles may be used within the realm of forecasting. To do this, we will be making use of publicly available historical data with regards to energy consumption, the weather, as well as public calendar holidays alongside other temporal variables in hopes of answering the following questions: are there any repeated consumption patterns that we are able to extract from historical data? If so, can we find similarities in those patterns and connect them to external factors and finally, can we find periodicity in those patterns?
